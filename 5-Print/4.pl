# Operator Precedence and Associativity
# Operator precedence and associativity in Perl 
# determine the order in which operators are evaluated. 

my $result = 5 + 3 * 2;
print "Result: $result\n";

# This code calculates the value of the expression 5 + 3 * 2, 
# which has multiplication (*) at a higher precedence than addition (+). The result is 11.
