# Double-Quoted String Literals
# Double-quoted string literals in Perl are enclosed in double quotes, 
# and any special characters or escape sequences inside the string are interpreted. 

my $name = "John";
my $greeting = "Hello, $name!";   # a double-quoted string literal
print $greeting;                  # prints "Hello, John!"
